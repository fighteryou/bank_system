# bank_system
This system has implemented simple functions for bank, from front end to back database.

The whole project is divided into three main parts, teller, esb, and ensemble.
Teller is the part for front end. The job for esb is connecting front and back, to make things work well.
Ensemble takes the responsibility for back end, the database. As all we know, there exists a smaller database
for teller, to store some normal data which is not so important or should be on the surface.This system holds three roles, clients, clerks, managers.

We used myecilpse for web development, oracle for database system. In details, we established the tables in database(oracle), and did the development in myecilpse. The server we chose is tomcat,which myecilpse comes with.The frame for teller is html,jsp,servlet,jdbc,process.

Actually, this system can finish several functions for a bank, from client interface to database storage.
1.client registeration<br>
2.create account<br>
3.change password<br>
4.save money<br>
5.transfer<br>
6.create new loan<br>
7.check account<br>
8.loan drawdown<br>
9.settle pay<br>
10.invoice<br>
11.loan receipt<br>
12.receipt settle<br>
and so on.
